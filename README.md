# MV_LicensePlate
The objective of this project is to segment and recognize the characters of a car's licence plate. 
This was done in one month for school purpose. Several parts can be modified to improve the result. 
The algorithm and the results are presented in the report (pdf file) of each part. 
The first part is about the segmentation of the plate in the picture, the second part is about the recognition of the characters.

This repository contains 3 folders: 

    >LicencePlate_segmentation
    This folder contains all the matlab code to output a picture containing the area where the plate is.
    This folder contain a report about this part, explaining the segmentation, explaining the algorithm and analyzing the results.
    
    >LicencePlate_recognition
    THis folder contain all the matlab code to output the characters of the licence plate. 
    It's more effective with a plate extracted from a picture with the segmentation part of the project.
    Here also, a report, as a pdf file, is explaining the algorithm and analyzing the overall results.

    >SimpleGrayScale_segmentation
    This folder contain a basic segmentation process that can be use as an introduction to the whole project. 
    A report, as a pdf file, is explaining the basic principle, the objectives and the methods used.
