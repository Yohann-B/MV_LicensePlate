I used the "main/functions" format for this application.
Therefore one file should be open to set up the uses of the 
function that contain the main code.

To run it:

	- open "main.m" with matlab;
	- select a picture from the folder "car";
	- press f5;

The file "licensePlate_segmentation.pdf" is explaining the
algorithm and give details about the project and the results.

The folder "PROTOTYPES" contains some functions to improve 
the algorithm. As their names is saying it, they does not 
process correctly and therefore, are given as some 
information.
