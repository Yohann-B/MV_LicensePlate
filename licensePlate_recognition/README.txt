To run the code, open the file "extractChars.m" 
and press F5.

The folder "MySet" contains the pictures of the 
charaters used in the set.

The folder "pictures" contains several plates
images we are experimenting on.

Th function "compare2set.m" is checking the 
differences and the similitudes between the
plate's character and each one in the set.

"creaSet.m" allows the user to create a set to 
compare characters to using the pictures in 
"MySet".

"cutPlate.m" is a function that segment the 
characters of the plate.

"myResize.m" is a basic function used to resize
segmented characters to those of the set.

The pdf file is containing explanations about
the algorithm and practical tests.
