I used the 'script' format for this application.
Therefore a file containing the main code needs to be run.

To run it:

	- open "threshold_segment.m" with matlab;
	- select a picture from the folder "figures";
	- press f5;

The file "simpleGrayScale_segmentation.pdf" is explaining the
algorithm and give details about the project and the results.

The other files are used as functions to allow the main code 
to work correctly.
